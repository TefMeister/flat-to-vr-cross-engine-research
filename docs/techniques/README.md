## Frame timing

The single hardest milestone. The goal is always the same: drive the runtime callbacks
(`on_wait_rendering`, `on_begin_rendering`, `update_hmd_state`) at the right instants and keep
engine/render/present frame counters aligned. Engines expose **different signals** to do it:

- **Reflex-marker style** (seen in `starfield2vr` / Creation Engine 2): the engine already
  instruments its loop with NVIDIA Reflex markers, so the adapter hooks the marker function and
  decodes markers to a timeline — reusing existing instrumentation as a free, reliable clock.
- **Two-hook style** (seen in `anvilengine2vr` / Anvil): no markers to lean on, so the adapter
  hand-finds and hooks **two engine functions** — "begin engine frame" and "begin render frame"
  — and drives the callbacks + counters from those.

Lesson: your engine's timing model is dictated by what signals it exposes. Look first for
existing instrumentation (Reflex, ETW, a frame-index global); fall back to hooking the engine's
own frame-begin functions.

## Stereo submission strategies

From best-quality to most-compatible:

1. **Native stereo** — drive the engine's built-in stereo path. This is what UEVR's "Native Stereo"
   mode does on Unreal, and what REFramework does on RE Engine (whose OpenVR path ships in the
   engine). **Don't assume only modern Unreal-class engines qualify** — see
   [dormant native stereo paths](#dormant-native-stereo-paths) below.
2. **Synchronized sequential** — render both eyes on the *same* engine tick; fixes many effect
   bugs at a performance cost (a UEVR mode).
3. **AFR (alternating frame rendering)** — one eye per engine tick; per-eye framerate is halved.
   The default for closed engines that render the world once per frame.
4. **AER (alternating eye rendering)** — an AFR refinement (Luke Ross R.E.A.L.): render one eye,
   **reproject** the other from the previous frame (L, R+reproj-L, L+reproj-R, …), with
   "yaw folding"/camera-rotation compensation for smooth turning. The answer when an engine
   *refuses* to draw the world twice per frame and you can't hit 2× framerate. AER 2.0 largely
   fixed early ghosting. Dedicated page: [per-game native mods & AER](../per-game-native-mods/).

## Dormant native stereo paths

Before committing to building stereo yourself, check whether the engine already contains it. Three
public examples show this is not rare:

- **Unreal** ships a live native stereo path; UEVR activates it through reflection.
- **RE Engine** ships an OpenVR path in the engine itself; REFramework switches it on.
- **id Tech 6** (DOOM, 2016) carries a **complete but unexposed** stereo-3D subsystem — mode enum,
  separation/eye-swap/GUI-offset cvars, and an AFR-vs-both-eyes toggle — inherited from the Doom 3
  BFG generation and reachable by nothing in the shipping game's UI.

The third case is the instructive one, because it is found **statically, by string inspection alone**,
in an engine with no VR-runtime strings anywhere in it. See the
[id Tech 6 case study](../case-studies/id-tech-6-dormant-stereo.md) and the widened search heuristic
in [`engines-index.md`](../engines-index.md#how-to-identify-an-unknown-engine-static-no-launch-needed).

**Three cautions before you get excited:**

1. **Compiled-in is not the same as working.** Strings prove the code was built into the binary.
   They say nothing about whether it still functions after years of patches on a path nobody ships.
   Verify it renders before you design around it.
2. **Vintage stereo was built for 3D TVs and shutter glasses, not HMDs.** Expect it to give you
   correct *stereo* — real binocular depth — without necessarily giving correct *per-eye positional*
   geometry. In the id Tech 6 case the engine's own doc-comment says the two stereo world views are
   *identical and centered between the eyes*, with separation applied downstream as a
   projection/screen-space step. That is a different thing from two properly offset eye views, and it
   points your override at the **projection** stage.
3. **No dormant path of that era supplies head tracking.** You inherit the plumbing — two views, two
   targets, eye swap, GUI depth — and still write all of the pose input yourself.

Even with all three caveats, a dormant path is worth finding: it hands you the engine authors' own
answers to "how do I get two views out of this renderer", which is normally the expensive part.

## Temporal effects under AFR

TAA, motion vectors, and NVIDIA-history-style features assume frame N+1 continues frame N's
viewpoint. AFR breaks that (consecutive frames are different eyes), producing a **stereo-but-
smeared** image. Two legitimate, opposite fixes seen in public adapters:

- **Keep the effect, fix it per eye** (Creation Engine 2): double-buffer the temporal history
  per eye (ping-pong the history resources by frame parity) so each eye keeps its own history.
  More work; preserves TAA/DLSS quality.
- **Disable the effect** (Anvil): byte-patch the TAA function out (and similar for letterbox).
  Cheaper; avoids the per-eye bug entirely; loses the AA.

Which is "right" is engine-dependent — fix per eye when quality matters and the history is
reachable; patch it off when it isn't worth it.

## Basis & handedness

The dominant cause of a broken first-eye injection ("the world swims when I turn my head") is a
wrong coordinate basis. Engines differ in up-axis (Y-up vs Z-up) and handedness. The standard
per-eye view composition round-trips through the runtime's basis:

```
transform = BASIS_ENGINE_TO_RUNTIME × rotation_offset × hmd_transform × eye × BASIS_RUNTIME_TO_ENGINE
view = view × transform          // (right-multiplied onto the engine's own view matrix)
```

Get the two basis matrices right for your engine first (log matrices in milestone 3 before you
ever write one in milestone 5). Watch for row- vs column-major (transpose) mismatches.

## Main-camera discrimination

You must apply VR only to the **main scene camera**, not to shadow-map or reflection cameras
(which also compute view/projection matrices). Public adapters use cheap discriminators — e.g.
**a far-plane threshold** (the main camera's far plane is large; shadow/reflection far planes are
small), or render-target size/format. Pick a signal that reliably isolates the world view on your
engine.

## HUD & UI in VR

A flat HUD stretched across a 100°+ field is unreadable and nauseating. The common recipe:
**expand the scissor/viewport** to the full eye render target (stop clipping), then **rescale the
UI** by user-tunable factors, and **suppress the head-tracked camera override while UI is
showing** (so menus don't move with your head). Dialog/letterbox overlays often need special
handling and are a frequent source of one-eye-only or letterboxed UI artifacts.
